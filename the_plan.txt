GOOGLE SIGN OUT CODE SNIPPET
<a href="#" onclick="signOut();">Sign out</a>
<script>
  function signOut() {
    var auth2 = gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance();
    auth2.signOut().then(function () {
      console.log('User signed out.');
    });
  }
</script>

POTENTIAL CODE FOR PDF CHALLENGE
First of all you need to set the responseType to arraybuffer. This is required if you want to create a blob of your data. See Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data. So your code will look like this:

$http.post('/postUrlHere',{myParams}, {responseType:'arraybuffer'})
  .success(function (response) {
       var file = new Blob([response], {type: 'application/pdf'});
       var fileURL = URL.createObjectURL(file);
});
The next part is, you need to use the $sce service to make angular trust your url. This can be done in this way:

$scope.content = $sce.trustAsResourceUrl(fileURL);
Do not forget to inject the $sce service.

If this is all done you can now embed your pdf:

<embed ng-src="{{content}}" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></embed>
